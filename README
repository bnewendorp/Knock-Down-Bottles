This is just a template example of how to use GLUT and Juggler
together. All the example does right now is just fade in some
lights to a blue clear color, nothing fancy.

You need to have a few dependencies built on both sides to run
this template. On OS X, you will have to have OSG built and
installed in /Library/Frameworks. You will also have to have
gmtl built and installed in /opt/local/include/gmtl-0.5.4.

As for the Linux Juggler side, you will have to set a few
environment variables in your .cshrc file including:

setenv OSG_HOME /home/users/cnoon15/Libraries/OpenSceneGraph-2.8.2
setenv VJ_BASE_DIR /home/users/cnoon15/Libraries/vrjuggler-2.3.16
setenv FLAGPOLL_PATH /home/users/cnoon15/Libraries/vrjuggler-2.3.16/lib64/flagpoll
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib64:${OSG_HOME}/lib64

If you have any problems or questions ask Christian, Brandon, or
Ken as they use this method of development for most all Juggler
applications.

Thanks,
